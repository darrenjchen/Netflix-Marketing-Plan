# Netflix Product Marketing Plan

## Overview
This project was a strategic marketing simulation focused on solving Netflix’s subscriber loss and identifying new market segments. Our team built a go-to-market plan that introduced a **tiered pricing model**, partnered with **Xbox Game Pass**, and restructured promotional strategies to reach Gen Z, millennials, and gaming audiences.

## Objectives
- Address Netflix's subscriber decline and revenue drop
- Develop a marketing strategy for retention and acquisition
- Explore bundling opportunities and price sensitivity
- Apply STP and 4P frameworks to a real-world scenario

## Key Strategies

### Segmentation, Targeting & Positioning (STP)
- **Segmentation**: Age, geography (North America & Europe), education level, profession
- **Targeting**: Students, Gen Z, millennial professionals, and family accounts
- **Positioning**: “Flexible entertainment for gamers and streamers” — with a focus on affordability and content value

### Product
- Introduced a **Netflix + Xbox Game Pass Bundle** with game streaming access
- Revamped pricing to include:
  - **Ad-supported free tier** (2 devices)
  - **Standard tier** ($9.99/month with student discount)
  - **Premium tier** ($14.99/month)
  - **Bundle tier** ($19.99/month with Xbox Game Pass)

### Price
- Used psychological pricing ($19.99) to position the bundle attractively
- 33% savings compared to buying Netflix and Xbox separately
- First-time offer: $7.99/month for the first 3 months of the bundle

### Promotion
- Leveraged **YouTube Ads**, **TikTok**, **Instagram**, and **Google Display Network**
- Targeted university campuses, gaming subreddits, and online communities
- Focused on engagement-driven creative (e.g., behind-the-scenes footage, gaming + show mashups)

### Place
- Made bundles available via **Netflix**, **Microsoft Store**, and **Xbox ecosystem**
- Replaced older Netflix ads with campaign-focused creatives across digital platforms

## Tools Used
- Canva (mock advertisements)
- PowerPoint (stakeholder presentation)
- Market research using Business Insider, Fortune, and SEC filings

## Outcome
- Final strategy presented in a simulated stakeholder pitch
- Recommendations aligned with Netflix's brand, revenue model, and market trends
- Practiced real-world PMM workflows: campaign planning, pricing psychology, market research, and GTM rollout

## Lessons Learned
- How bundling expands perceived value and reaches adjacent markets (i.e., gaming)
- Importance of price anchoring and entry-level tiers in user acquisition
- Value of targeting based on media consumption and lifestyle, not just demographics
